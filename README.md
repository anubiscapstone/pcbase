Human side code

Anubis is a fun acronym that stands for A Natural User Bot Interface System. Anubis is a senior design project at 
Ohio Northern University. Our overall goal is to design a system that uses human body motion to control a robot.

To complete this project, we are using various hardware components that are available on the market for consumers. 
This allows developers and tinkerers alike to try a hand at our system and create something new with it.

By the end of April, our goal is to have a fully functioning system. The hope is to have the user never touch a 
keyboard or joystick. Their body will do all of the controlling.

Using the Application
Application
The application in this system is a server that allows robots to connect and receive the
body position information. It handles the hardware input and network communication. In its
current stage, the front panel of the application provides little feedback to the status of the
system.
Starting Application
First step in running the application on the PC is making sure the Microsoft Kinect’s
USB is plugged into your computer. Make sure to also plug in the power cable running from
the Kinect into a power source such as a wall socket. A green light will appear on the Kinect if
the Kinect is successfully plugged into both the computer and a power source. Next, in order
to run the application, you must have the executable file on your computer, or you will need
the Microsoft Visual Studio project on your computer (assuming you have Visual Studio 2010
or later). Run the executable file or open the Visual Studio project solution file and click on the
“Start” button. A GUI form will be displayed on your computer monitor and the application will
be running.
Controlling the Robot
Human users will control the robot just by moving their arms around. The Kinect will
sense these movements and tell the robot how to move accordingly. To drive the treads on
the robot, the user’s wrists need to be below the waist. To drive the robot forward, users
simply put both hands out in front of them but still below their waist. To drive the robot
backward, users simply put both hands behind them but still below their waist. To make the
robot not drive at all, users should put their hands down to their sides below the waist. Users
who want to turn the robot left, should put their right hand out in front of them (below their
waist still) and put their left hand either at their side or behind them (below their waist still).
Users who want to turn the robot right, should put their left hand out in front of them (below
their waist still) and put their right hand either at their side or behind them (below their waist
still). To move the robot’s arms, the users wrists need to be above their waist. Making the
motion of a jumping jack (only moving the arms) will move the robot’s arms up and down on
its sides. To move the arms of the robot in towards its “chest”, users simply move their arms
in towards their waist.
